      <ul>
        <li>
          The players take turns, with the player who goes first dropping one of
          their discs into any of the seven columns at the top of the game
          board.
        </li>
        <li>
          The disc will drop down to the lowest available space in the chosen
          column.
        </li>
        <li>
          The game ends when one player successfully connects four of their
          colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or
          diagonally.
