## #1 squareNumber(num)

Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and output to the console.  
```text
squareNumber(3);
> The result of squaring the number 3 is 9.
```


## #2 halfNumber(num)

Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and output to the console.  
```text
halfNumber(5);
> Half of 5 is 2.5.
```

## #3 percentOf(num, num)

Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and output to the console.  
```text
percentOf(2, 4);
> 2 is 50% of 4.
```

## #4 areaOfCircle(num)

Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and output to the console.  
```text
areaOfCircle(2);
> The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172.
```


## #5 allTheStuff(num)

Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, **using the functions you wrote earlier**:  

a. Take half of the number and store the result.  
b. Square the result of (a) and store that result.  
c. Calculate the area of a circle with the result of (b) as the radius.  
d. Calculate what percentage that the original number is the area (c)

```text
allTheStuff(7);
> Half of 7 is 3.5.
> The result of squaring the number 3.5 is 12.25.
> The result of squaring the number 12.25 is 150.0625.
> The area for a circle with radius 12.25 is 471.43524757931834.
> 7 is 1.4848274574170994% of 471.43524757931834.
```

## Additional details
- name your file numbers.js
- practice function documentation
- keep your code DRY (don't repeat yourself) - used functions you've previously created
